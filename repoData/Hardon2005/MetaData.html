		<td>Abstract:</td>
		<td><p>This dataset contains the results of a soil sampling effort undertaken in 2005 along a landscape gradient within the Bonanza Creek LTER.  Soils were sampled at 5 sites located within unique vegetative environments ranging from a wetland to an upland forest over a distance of 260 m.  Data includes, but is not limited to percent carbon, percent nitrogen, 13C of the gas phase, 14C of the gas phase, 13C of the solid phase, bulk density, CO2 flux and DOC</p></td>

		<td>Methods:</td>
		<td><p>We collected the top 5 cm of soil using a 4.25 cm diameter corer, taking extreme care to minimize any soil compaction during the coring process.  We measured both the length of core that was retrieved and the depth of the hole from which it came to ensure that the material was not compacted. We then sectioned off the top 5 cm of the core for analysis.  Our samples across all locations along the gradient generally consisted of organic material (including live moss and leaf litter for some samples) and organic soil.  While still in the field, samples were transferred intact into pre-weighed, hard leaching cups (Nalgene filter cups with Whatman GF-F glass fiber filters and glass wool), which then were placed immediately into 0.5 L mason jars with modified lids (with septa to enable syringe sampling) and sealed. Samples were shipped to Menlo Park, CA within 24 hrs.  Immediately following shipping, samples were incubated at constant room temperature (approximately 20-24°C ) at field moisture conditions in the dark. We measured CO2 flux, DOC concentration and d13C and d14C isotopic composition of the CO2 from a combined incubation and leaching experiment modified from Neff and Hooper (2002).  We measured potential CO2 production rates at 2, 7, 9, 12, 21, and 26 days after field collection (2004) and 2, 9, 18, 25, and 31 days after field collection (2005).  Each time we measured CO2 production rates, we capped the jars and measured changes in CO2 concentrations in the headspace 0, 24, and 48 hrs after jars were sealed.  After the 48 hr period, jars were uncapped and covered with saran wrap to minimize evaporation. Before capping jars again, we flushed each jar with room air to ensure that each headspace was well mix prior to measuring CO2 production rates.   We calculated CO2 flux rates as the linear slope of headspace CO2 concentrations versus time.  We estimated CO2 dissolved in soil pore waters using Henry’s Law, CO2 equilibrium constants, water volume, temperature, and pH. Immediately following the estimation of CO2 production rates at days 7 and 9 (2004) and 9 and 18 (2005), samples were leached with de-ionized water to quantify DOC concentrations and d13C signatures.  For the leaching procedure, soils within the Nalgene filter cups were taken out of the mason jars and saturated with 100 mL of water for approximately 30 minutes.  The samples were then connected to a vacuum line to recover 100 mL of leachate from the sample. The moisture content did not change as a result of the leaching although it did become drier over the course of the incubation (this is discussed later in the context of flux rates).  Moisture content was determined gravimetrically at the start of each CO2 production rate period by monitoring weights of the mason jars over time. At the end of the experiment, samples were oven dried for 48 hours at 60°C. Initial water content of each sample was calculated as the difference between the initial mass and the oven-dried mass. Volumetric water content (VWC) was monitored gravimetrically (weight of jar, water, dry sample) and ranged from 18% to super-saturation (> 100%; water standing at the base of the jar) across sampling locations along our wetland gradient (Figure 2).  Soil C and N concentrations were quantified using a Carlo-Erba C/N analyzer. Leachates were analyzed for DOC and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) on a Shimadzu TOC-Vcpn. Samples were acidified to pH 2-3 and sparged to remove dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Gaseous 13C was done INSET and stable C isotopes of the DOC were done INSERT</p></td>
